# 🍔 Food Delivery Platform Security Architecture Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on securing a food delivery platform that is being expanded from an internal-only service to one that supports public users and third-party providers. The platform will expose internal services via mobile and web applications, as well as public APIs. This transition demands a comprehensive security architecture to safeguard systems, data, network, and infrastructure.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure the secure exposure of internal services to external parties
- Protect sensitive data such as user credentials, payment information, and order data
- Build a security-first architecture that is scalable, compliant, and resilient
- Meet industry standards (OWASP, STRIDE, GDPR, PCI-DSS)

## ✅ Deliverables
| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Security Requirements | Identified functional/non-functional security needs including authentication, authorization, encryption, and data privacy |
| 2. Threat Modelling | STRIDE-based analysis of threats to platform components and data flows |
| 3. Security Controls | Defined and mapped controls such as RBAC, TLS 1.3, WAF, OAuth2, input validation, and rate limiting |
| 4. Security Architecture | Documented architecture views (logical, physical, trust boundary, data flow) with layered defenses |
| 5. Test & Verification | Designed and executed test cases to verify control effectiveness, including pen testing and vulnerability scans |

## 🧩 Architecture Layers
- **Presentation Layer**: Web/mobile apps secured with HTTPS, secure tokens, and CSP
- **API Gateway Layer**: Throttling, authentication, input sanitization
- **Application Services**: Secure inter-service communication, RBAC enforcement, logging
- **Data Layer**: AES-256 encryption, row-level permissions, tokenization
- **Infrastructure**: Private subnets, WAF, firewall rules, monitoring

---

## 🔐 Key Security Practices
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and MFA
- TLS 1.3 for all communication
- Role-based access control
- Automated logging and monitoring
- Security incident detection and response
- Compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS

---

## 🧪 Security Testing Tools
- **OWASP ZAP** / **Burp Suite** – Web and API vulnerability scanning
- **Nessus** / **OpenVAS** – Network/infrastructure scanning
- **Snyk** / **Checkmarx** – Dependency and source code analysis
- **Custom scripts** – For rate limiting, session expiry, access violations
